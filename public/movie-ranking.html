<h1>The Best Movies According To Muhammad</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>John Wick (Chapter 1)</h3>
<p>Without a doubt,this movie has some special place in my heart regardless of all the marvel movies that have earned over billion dollars </p>
<h3>Nobody</h3>
<p>This movie is directed by the same person who directed John Wick, so this movie has to be on my list</p>
<h3>KGF (Chapter 2)</h3>
<p>It's a bollywood movie that has some of the finest story<br />and every moment is full of thrill and suspense
</p>
<h3>Now For Anime </h3>
<p>I have recently finished watching solo leveling and It was way above my expectations. <br >Like literally everything was just outstanding</p>
